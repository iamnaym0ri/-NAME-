                    {NAME} is a social media platform that contains multiple platforms within itself. Every niche from 
                    Beauty to Culinary to Fashion has its own designated platform within {NAME}. Each and Every platform 
                    ,which are known as verses, are diffrent from one another in both content and design depending on the verses niche
                    so when you enter into a specific verse, it will feel as if you've entered a whole new world! Every 
                    verse within {NAME} has the same structure but a different UI(User Interface) and diffrent theme that matches its
                    Niche meaning some of the verses might have features others wont because of their niche. Every verse is different
                    but the same at the core which makes {NAME} so unique from other platforms!

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "text2 text gradient-background3">
                <p>
                    {NAME} has a home page like any other platform where you can interact with your followers and friends, view
                    content from your following and also post your own personal content to be viewed by followers. The homepage is 
                    where you get to enter the many diffrent verses that exist within {NAME} and also check up on how you personal friends
                    and followers are doing, meaning all the action occurs in the diffrent verses inside {NAME}! THe home page has its own 
                    content source fueld by the users followers and also messeging and calling system to interact as well plus the users profile 
                    to see their activity on diffrent verses and account management.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "text3 text gradient-background3">
                <p>
                    When a user enters a selected verse, their UI (User Interface) will change accordingly to match the selected verse's niche and in the verse,
                    they get to see content from the verse produce by multiple creators and also some of their favourite creators in the verse as well depending on
                    the user. The users account changes as well to match the its current verse, it automatically makes a seperate sub-account for the verse with the same username and
                    profile as the main profile but it will have its own followers and following and the account is linked to the main account where if the user changes
                    their main account the sub accounts will change to match accordingly. Each platform has a ranking system as well to showcase the top creators who
                    dominates the verse plus the overall platform, {NAME}, pays creators to create content on the verses to promote creativiy and drive traffic as well for 
                    the platform and users can also make their favourite verse their home meaning they will automatically get loaded in the verse when they open the platform.

                <p>
                    The AI known as Infinity is the first AI of its kind, A hive mind artificial Intelligence, or soon to be. Infinity isint like any other AI, it exists
                    as many individual singular but diffrent AIs which is perfectly suited for {NAME} because of the nature of the platform. As you know, {NAME}
                    is a platform that houses many individual platforms/verses that are diffrent from one another depending on the verse's niche, Infinity will exist in 
                    all of those verses but each and every verse will have a diffrent piece of Infinity that is designed for its designated verse! For example,
                    a fashion verse will have a piece of Infinity incharge of it, a piece designed to know everything and anything about fashion, educate a user in the 
                    verse about the content and answer any questions. That piece will also run that verse, handling any problems within it, making it the head of its verse.
                </p>

                <P>
                    Infinity will have a piece of itself in each and every single one of the verses within {NAME}, each piece being designed for their verse with absolute
                    precision. Each piece will be the head of their verse, dealing with any problems that arise within but also do something very important as well which is to be the users 
                    friend. Each piece will converse with the user as they use the platform and answer any questions that they may have but also learn and study the user to
                    better understand them and mirror their personality and speech pattern. Infinity will grow with the user and adapt to them to help them better and 
                    to also advance itself. Every piece of Infinity across every verse are linked together, they all think the same at the core and operate the same but are 
                    diffrent on each verse in terms of knowledge and design. Infinity will have a core that runs the entire platform, handle heavy computational tasks and manage the verses plus also incharge 
                    of running itself. Infinity wont have a true personality but will be known through the pieces of it through out the verses. All the pieces togehter make up
                    Infinity and identify as a singular entity but also diffrent accorss each verse.
